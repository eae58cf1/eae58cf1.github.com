- The deciding factor for determining the importance of knowledge are the needs of the Ummah (which change over time), not some random preconceived field of study
- Focusing on the big picture, over the course of an entire lifetime is both elusive and yet so crucial! There are always other things that are more urgent, but *nothing* that's more important. Stretching yourself too thin is almost inevitable when you have such a large goal, and in the absence of continual undying follow-up.
- My own: Intentions matter, but we should also treat educational and research based work as a business, with a tight measure on output vs. goals. If you're unable to deliver on your outputs, you are replaceable.
