What lured me in to reading this book was the title: *Be so good they can't ignore you*. Yup, definitely fits my work-your-ass-off mindset .. I was game.

The intro was great &mdash; but it just went downhill from there. Wasn't long before I felt like chucking the book out the window (Alas, it was an ebook and I wasn't about to throw my Kindle out).

The scientific basis of the book was shaky .. at best. All of the evidence cited was anecdotal .. and even then, the *"lessons"* he extrapolated from them were unconvincing.

I think part of my bone picking with this book is that it only considers one viable career path -- which is working in some sort of job. Even the example that he cited, of some folks working a farm, depended to a large extent on professional qualifications. I think the book would have worked out a lot more if the scope was increased to include examples of hustlers that got their way in business .. people like Uber's [Travis Kalanick](https://swooshing.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/startup-seed-raising-skillzzz/) (who knew nothing about cars or the transportation industry).

Still, there were some bits I found useful .. you'll find them below.

## Notable quotes

> [Chris] Rock, it turns out, will make somewhere between forty to fifty unannounced visits to a small New Jersey–area comedy club to help him figure out which material works and which doesn’t.

> To initiate these efforts, I chose a paper that was well cited in my research niche, but that was also considered obtuse and hard to follow. The paper focused on only a single result—the analysis of an algorithm that offers the best-known solution to a well-known problem. Many people have cited this result, but few have understood the details that support it. I decided that mastering this notorious paper would prove a perfect introduction to my new regime of self-enforced deliberate practice.

I get this feeling alot &mdash; of going through long research papers and not understanding anything. I think his approach here, to break things down and essentially force yourself through it, could work wonders.

> Strain, I now accepted, was good. Instead of seeing this discomfort as a sensation to avoid, I began to understand it the same way that a body builder understands muscle burn: a sign that you’re doing something right.
