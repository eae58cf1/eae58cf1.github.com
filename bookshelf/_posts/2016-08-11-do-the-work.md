Important not to overthink things -- research to a certain point, but beyond that just take the plunge on faith.

> Once we commit to action, the worst thing that we can do is to stop. What will keep us from stopping? Plain old stubbornness.

There's another quote that I find pretty fascinating (and particularly relevant to my current state of thinking):

> “Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now.”

Research can become Resistance. As with all things, it's important but only in small portions. We want to work, not prepare to work.

One interesting take away from the book is this quote here:

> Our greatest fear is fear of success

Now this sounds absolutely ridiculous at first. How can success possibly be a fear? But when you think about it abit more, you come to realize that, for lack of a better word, *success* could actually be it.

The higher you climb, the greater the fall.

He also focuses on the importance of finishing quickly (and then revising), as opposed to trying to make something perfect. (This fits quite nicely with the Lean Startup methodology that I so emphatically support).
