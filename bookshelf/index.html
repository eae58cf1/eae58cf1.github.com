{% assign books = site.categories.bookshelf %}
<p>A list of some of the books that I've read, with the most recent ones listed first. You'll notice that I mostly read business books, though there are some other genres in there too.</p>

<ul class="post-list">
  {% for book in books %}
    <li>
      <div class="media">
        <div class="media-image">
          <img class="cover" src="/assets/bookshelf/{{ book.cover }}" title="{{ book.title }}">
        </div>
        <div class="media-body">
          {% if book.reading == 1 %}
            <h3>{{ book.title }}</h3>
            *Currently reading*
          {% else %}
            <h3><a href="{{ book.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ book.title }}</a></h3>
            {% include rating.html rating=book.rating %}
          {% endif %}
