<p>His philosophy, one he repeats throughout the book, is one I tend to agree with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another thing that really reverberated with me was the focus on <em>winning</em>, and not just on <em>not losing</em> .. It’s pretty amazing, lamenting on this statement, how I often think about things through the same lens. I often catch myself trying to “minimize my losses” and account for the “worst case scenario” (e.g. calculating runway before I have to move back to my parents house or get a job) vs. looking at the upside. I don’t spend nearly enough time thinking about winning.</p>

<p>Interesting facts, having read the book:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He was still running a day job after making $86K in sales that year, and with 4 full time employees. Wow.</li>
  <li>The supplier troubles he initially faced with Onitsuka sound oddly familiar to me, having been through the Network International experience. Being at the mercy of a single supplier is a ticking time bomb. Not a matter of if but when (it’ll blow up)</li>
  <li>One thing that strikes me is that the entire concept of Nike, to begin with, was one of a reseller. They didn’t design the shoes at first — they just sold them (occasionally funneling customer feedback to the factory and tweaking things accordingly).
This is a big deal.
Even with a company that was so lame and boring (business-wise), he managed to create a sense of purpose and instill values in the company that made it much more than just a shoe reseller.
This is the power of vision, and the importance of setting &amp; having a mission.</li>
</ul>
