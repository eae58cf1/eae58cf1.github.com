  <h2 id="what-is-white">What is White?</h2>
<p><a href="http://whitepayments.com">White Payments</a> was a company I founded in May 2014 to make it easy for startups in the Middle East to get paid online. It was acquired by <a href="https://payfort.com">Payfort</a>, the largest payment provider in the region, just one year later.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-payment-solution">Why a payment solution?</h2>
<p>I didn’t start off wanting to build a credit card processing service … I had plans to create an Uber-like service in my native Bahrain and had built all the bits of my MVP (Minimum Viable Product — essentially, a proof of concept), leaving the credit card part till the end. After finishing up the other stuff, I came to the credit card section and was lost. I’d originaly set aside a couple of hours for it, but hours came and went and I was no closer to finding a solution. Finally, when it became apparent that I’d need to meet a bank, I did … and was shocked at how backwards the whole experience was. I later found out that in Dubai, you had to pay $10,000 before you could start processing a single dollar. $10,000!</p>

<p>It quickly became clear to me that this was a bigger issue — one worth focusing on.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>It’s a long story. You can read more about it on the Startup Bahrain page <a href="http://www.startupmgzn.com/english/features/white-payments-never-give-up/">here</a> but in a nutshell: I built a first version, hired a CTO, launched to the public, processed six figures, got shut down by our only bank and finally got acquired. All in a year.</p>

<p>You can read about the acquisition officially on <a href="http://www.payfort.com/press/payfort-acquisition-of-white-payments-to-help-empower-new-generation-of-entrepreneurs/">Payfort</a>, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248605">Entrepreneur magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.wamda.com/2015/06/payfort-acquires-white-payments-builds-online-payment-ecosystem">Wamda</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<p>Our team joined the Souq group, working with Payfort full time. We rolled the product out under a new brand called <a href="https://start.payfort.com">Payfort Start</a>:</p>
