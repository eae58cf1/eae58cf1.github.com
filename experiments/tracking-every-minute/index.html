<h2 id="the-experiment">The experiment</h2>
<p>Have you ever looked back at the end of a long day and thought: my God, that day just flew by! I can’t even remember where all the time went. Or perhaps you’ve caught yourself wondering, at the end of a not particularly productive year, how it feels like the year just started yesterday.</p>

<p>Well, I have. So to know where all this time is going, I’m going to be tracking every minute of very day for a full month.</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Track <em>everything</em> that’s over 15 minutes long. (The reason I do this is to maintain sanity — no point tracking anything less than that because it just becomes a distraction).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>My friend David (who’s <a href="http://david.achkar.com/new-experiment/">post on the topic</a> inspired me to do this whole thing) uses Google Calendar to do his tracking (and he’s made it public, so you can see it in real time <a href="http://david.achkar.com/life-log/">here</a>). However, I don’t use Google Calendar much so I decided I’d need another way to do this.</p>

<p>Since I already use a combination of Google Sheets and Google Forms for tracking my household spending, I thought it’d be a good idea to start there.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and created a simple Google form:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/experiments/track-every-minute-form.jpg" alt="&quot;Google form&quot;" /></p>

<p>Next, I added it to my phone as a home screen icon:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/experiments/track-every-minute-home-screen.jpg" alt="&quot;Home screen&quot;" /></p>

<p>That’s it! Now, whenever I want to track anything .. I can just hit the icon, fill in the details and hit Submit. Everything gets saved in a Google Sheet that I can then use for analysis.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>After doing this for about a month, here’s what I came up with:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/experiments/track-every-minute-results.png" alt="&quot;Results&quot;" /></p>

<p>You’ll notice all sorts of different color blocks, representing the different activities I was doing throughout the day. You can start to see trends develop — though having too many sub-categories does make it difficult to come up with any actionable insights.</p>

<p>I’ll be taking another stab at this exercise in the near future, where I’ll try to focus on coming up with some sort of “productivity score” for the day — something I can optimize over time.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I became more productive</strong>: I found this out early on. I started policing myself, automatically catching myself spending too much time on one activity or the other. It’s a great way to keep yourself in check, and a beneficial side-effect of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect">observer-expectancy effect</a>.</li>
</ul>
