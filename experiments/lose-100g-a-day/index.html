<h2 id="the-experiment">The experiment</h2>

<p>The world of weight loss is a very complicated one. There‚Äôs all sorts of diets, plans and routines that you‚Äôre supposed to follow ‚Äî and frankly, a large element of nonsense too.</p>

<p>But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. I mean, let‚Äôs consider a first principles approach to weight loss. Picture the human body as a lump of energy. According to the law of conservation of energy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the total energy of an isolated system remains constant‚Äîit is said to be conserved over time. <strong>Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it transforms from one form to another.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our bodies are not isolated systems ‚Äî we have energy coming in (when we eat/drink) and energy going out (for basic metabolism, exercise, etc.). However, if we just track both of those things, we should be able to accurately control the weight we lose / gain (since weight <em>is</em> energy).</p>

<p>The beauty of this approach, if it works, is that you can eat whatever you want. Bite the fatty backside of a bison if you like, a calorie is a calorie! Instead of focusing on the type of food, we focus on the caloric content (which is more directly influenced by the portion size).</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Track the energy coming into your body (calories in), and the energy going out (calories out)</li>
  <li>Make sure more energy is going out than coming in (by at least 100g/day)</li>
  <li>That‚Äôs it!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>First, I found my Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). That‚Äôs how many calories I‚Äôll burn a day even if I never get out of bed. It‚Äôs the energy my body consumes to stay alive.</p>

<p>To find your BMR, you can use the formula (which I got from <a href="https://bmi-calories.com/bmr-calculator.html">here</a>):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 * Weight_{kg}) + (4.799 * Height_{cm}) - (5.677 * Age)</script>

<p>Mine turned out to be 1,830 calories.</p>

<p>Ok, so the nett calorie count for the day \(Cal_{nett}\) is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Cal_{nett} = Cal_{in} - Cal_{out} - BMR</script>

<p>I convert \(Cal_{nett}\) into grams by dividing by 9, since 1g of fat is equivalent to 9 calories. That tells me how much weight I lost on a particular day.</p>

<p>Note that this does assume that your body absorbs 100% of the calories you eat, which is not true. The calories you eat represent a ceiling ‚Äî but a good chunk of the food you eat doesn‚Äôt get absorbed, and well - passes right through!</p>

<p>Assuming an absorption ratio of 95% (or 0.95):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Cal_{nett} = Cal_{in} * 0.95 - Cal_{out} - BMR</script>

<p>And, the math lesson is over üòÑ</p>

<p>I created a Google Sheet to calculate all this automatically:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/experiments/weight-loss-settings-sheet.png" alt="Google Sheet with Settings" /></p>

<p>And to make this all easier to track, I also setup a Google Form which I used to fill in the calories I consume/use every day:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/experiments/weight-loss-tracker.png" alt="Google form for tracking weight loss" /></p>

<p>(You can download both the Sheet &amp; Form <a href="#below">below</a>)</p>

<p>Everytime I eat something (or do some exercise), I log it in ‚Ä¶ and the sheet is updated automatically. At the end of the day, I throttle my calorie consumption to ensure that there‚Äôs always a net loss of 100g or so of body weight.</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Log all incoming and outgoing energy</li>
  <li>Stop eating once you‚Äôve hit a 100g deficit for a particular day</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="update-1-month">Update: 1 month</h2>

<p>Wow, this experiment has worked better than I could‚Äôve ever imagined! Checkout the results below:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/experiments/weight-loss-results-1-month.png" alt="Results after 1 month" /></p>

<p>The expected weight is 75.0kg as of today, but my actual weight (when I first wake up in the morning) is 74.5kg!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/experiments/weight-loss-results-1-month-actual.png" alt="Actual weight" /></p>

<p>That‚Äôs insane ‚Äî it means I‚Äôm actually losing <em>more</em> than 100g each day, since I‚Äôve lost 3.3kg to date (in just 30 days).</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to keep this experiment going for another month or so until I hit the 70kg range, which I think would be ideal. I‚Äôll make sure to share more details around the specifics of how I accomplished this, and tips you can use to do the same once I‚Äôve got a firm grip of things (say in a month or so).</p>

<div id="below"></div>

<h2 id="now-you-can-do-this-too">Now, you can do this too!</h2>

<p>Because I‚Äôm such a great guy, I‚Äôm sharing the Google Form &amp; Google Sheet templates that I used to track my progress:</p>

<p>üëâ <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bXvxypWbJ3iIjskVOsa7IHGkxrgQ7xCP?usp=sharing">Link to Google Form &amp; Sheet</a></p>

<p>To use this yourself:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy the Form and Sheet to your own Google Drive folder</li>
  <li>Update the Settings in the ‚Äú‚öôÔ∏è‚Äù sheet to include your own details</li>
  <li>Start tracking calories, and observe your progress in the ‚ÄúSummary‚Äù sheet!</li>
</ol>
