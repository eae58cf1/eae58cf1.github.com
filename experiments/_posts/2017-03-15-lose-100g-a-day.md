title: Losing 100g everyday

excerpt: |
  After several recent vacations (and food binges). I've always thought small changes done regularly are better than big changes done occasionally. So here's my take at it.

## The experiment
The world of weight loss is a very complicated one. There's all sorts of diets, plans and routines that you're supposed to follow &mdash; and frankly, a large element of nonsense too. It's better to take a first principles approach to this.

If we viewed the human body as a lump of energy, then it makes things simpler. According to the law of conservation of energy:

> the total energy of an isolated system remains constantâ€”it is said to be conserved over time. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it transforms from one form to another.

We're not completely isolated though. We have energy coming in (when we eat/drink) and energy going out (for basic metabolism, exercise, etc.). If we just track both of those things, we can accurately control the weight we gain / lose (since weight *is* energy).

In summary:
- Track the energy coming into my body (calories in), and the energy going out (calories out)
- Make sure that I'm using more energy than I'm consuming (by at least 100g/day)
- That's it!

## Setup
Using [a tool online](http://www.active.com/fitness/calculators/bmr), I found my Basal Metabolic Rate to be 1,830 calories. That's how many calories I'll burn a day even if I never get out of bed. It's the energy my body consumes to stay alive.

Next, I plugged everything into a Google sheet:

In case you're wondering how I can convert energy into weight, that's simple. Each macronutrient (carbs, protein, fat) corresponds directly with weight as follows:

| 1g of protein | 4 calories |
|---------------|------------|
| 1g of carbs   | 4 calories |
| 1g of fat     | 9 calories |

Told you it was simple.

Here's the form I use to fill in the calories I consume/use every day:

Everytime I eat something (or do some exercise), I log it in &hellip; and the sheet is updated automatically. At the end of the day, I throttle my calories consumption to ensure that there's always a net loss of 100g or so of body weight.

## Rules

- Log all incoming and outgoing energy
- Stop eating once you've hit a 100g deficit for a particular day
