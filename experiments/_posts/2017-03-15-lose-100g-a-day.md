  After several recent vacations (and food binges). I've always thought small changes done regularly are better than big changes done occasionally. So here's my take on it.

## The experiment

The world of weight loss is a very complicated one. There's all sorts of diets, plans and routines that you're supposed to follow &mdash; and frankly, a large element of nonsense too. 

But it doesn't have to be. I mean, let's consider a first principles approach to weight loss. Picture the human body as a lump of energy. According to the law of conservation of energy:

> the total energy of an isolated system remains constant‚Äîit is said to be conserved over time. **Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it transforms from one form to another.**

Our bodies are not isolated systems &mdash; we have energy coming in (when we eat/drink) and energy going out (for basic metabolism, exercise, etc.). However, if we just track both of those things, we should be able to accurately control the weight we lose / gain (since weight *is* energy).

The beauty of this approach, if it works, is that you can eat whatever you want. Bite the fatty backside of a bison if you like, a calorie is a calorie! Instead of focusing on the type of food, we focus on the caloric content (which is more directly influenced by the portion size).

In summary:
- Track the energy coming into your body (calories in), and the energy going out (calories out)
- Make sure more energy is going out than coming in (by at least 100g/day)
- That's it!

## Setup

First, I found my Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). That's how many calories I'll burn a day even if I never get out of bed. It's the energy my body consumes to stay alive.

To find your BMR, you can use the formula (which I got from [here](https://bmi-calories.com/bmr-calculator.html)):

$$BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 * Weight_{kg}) + (4.799 * Height_{cm}) - (5.677 * Age)$$

Mine turned out to be 1,830 calories.

Ok, so the nett calorie count for the day \\(Cal_{nett}\\) is:

$$Cal_{nett} = Cal_{in} - Cal_{out} - BMR$$

I convert \\(Cal_{nett}\\) into grams by dividing by 9, since 1g of fat is equivalent to 9 calories. That tells me how much weight I lost on a particular day.

Note that this does assume that your body absorbs 100% of the calories you eat, which is not true. The calories you eat represent a ceiling &mdash; but a good chunk of the food you eat doesn't get absorbed, and well - passes right through!

Assuming an absorption ratio of 95% (or 0.95):

$$Cal_{nett} = Cal_{in} * 0.95 - Cal_{out} - BMR$$

And, the math lesson is over üòÑ

I created a Google Sheet to calculate all this automatically:

And to make this all easier to track, I also setup a Google Form which I used to fill in the calories I consume/use every day:

![Google form for tracking weight loss](/assets/experiments/weight-loss-tracker.png)

(You can download both the Sheet &amp; Form [below](#below))

Everytime I eat something (or do some exercise), I log it in &hellip; and the sheet is updated automatically. At the end of the day, I throttle my calorie consumption to ensure that there's always a net loss of 100g or so of body weight.

## Rules

- Log all incoming and outgoing energy
- Stop eating once you've hit a 100g deficit for a particular day

## Update: 1 month

Wow, this experiment has worked better than I could've ever imagined! Checkout the results below:

![Results after 1 month](/assets/experiments/weight-loss-results-1-month.png)

The expected weight is 75.0kg as of today, but my actual weight (when I first wake up in the morning) is 74.5kg!

![Actual weight](/assets/experiments/weight-loss-results-1-month-actual.png)

That's insane &mdash; it means I'm actually losing *more* than 100g each day, since I've lost 3.3kg to date (in just 30 days). 

I'm going to keep this experiment going for another month or so until I hit the 70kg range, which I think would be ideal. I'll make sure to share more details around the specifics of how I accomplished this, and tips you can use to do the same once I've got a firm grip of things (say in a month or so).

## Now, you can do this too!

Because I'm such a great guy, I'm sharing the Google Form & Google Sheet templates that I used to track my progress: 

üëâ [Link to Google Form &amp; Sheet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bXvxypWbJ3iIjskVOsa7IHGkxrgQ7xCP?usp=sharing)

To use this yourself:

1. Copy the Form and Sheet to your own Google Drive folder
2. Update the Settings in the "‚öôÔ∏è" sheet to include your own details
3. Start tracking calories, and observe your progress in the "Summary" sheet!
