  I'd heard alot about Soylent (and Huel, in the UK) as a form of food that covers all your nutritional needs in just one powdered drink. Easy to make, cheap and nutritional &mdash; sounds like an experiment!

## The experiment
I'd heard alot about [Soylent](https://soylent.com) as a form of food that doesn't require any cooking: just add water, and hey presto! It's all nutritionally balanced, cheap(er than junk food) and filling. I don't spend much time eating (typically about 90 minutes a day) and generally enjoy it (probably because my wife does most of the cooking). Still, this is something I'd like to try &mdash; just to get a feel for how it feels to eat a balance diet (I generally over-eat).

## Rules

- Eat [Huel](http://huel.com) exclusively (Huel is the UK-equivalent of Soylent)
- Stick to 3 "meals" a day, with 3 scoops each (for a total calorie count of 1,500/day)
- Eat *nothing* else (water is fine, though!)
- Track weight and key body metrics before and after

## Setup
Since I'll be consuming less than the 2,000 calorie recommended daily intake, I do expect to lose weight during this period. Here's a look at what my key metrics look like before the trial (I'm using [this scale](http://amzn.eu/3IXVPSt)):

| Before:           |         |
|:------------------|--------:|
| Weight            | 78.3 kg |
| BMI               | 25.0    |
| % Fat             | 14.9%   |
| % Water           | 64.5%   |
| % Muscle          | 41.0%   |
| Bone weight       | 3.4 kg  |

I noticed that my BMI (Body Mass Index) is just at the edge of the normal range (anything > 25 is considered "over-weight"). This intervention came at the right time &mdash; let's hope it works out!

I also went ahead and ordered 4 bags of the good stuff:
