  Having joined less than a year and a half ago, it's time to say goodbye.

I'd been thinking about making this move for a while, and today the deed is finally done. I've left Payfort. I joined 17 months ago when the Souq group acquired White. We both had high hopes for how everything would go, and mixed expectations coming in.

We came in thinking that everything was already sorted out and that we'd be growing a product from the small base we already had to hundreds of thousands of customers across the region (leveraging the existing banking relationships Payfort had already established to skip the legal red tape). It turns out; there were no bank relationships. We had to build those, virtually from scratch. It's no wonder then that 17 months later, here we are &mdash; still not live with a single bank in the region.

I hate waiting, and especially having already spent the previous year in bank offices of various sizes, I wasn't about to spend the next several years of my life begging and pleading. After the final deadline that we had set passed, I handed in my resignation. We had been told we'd go live in "a month" and now I was done waiting.

Having said all this, I don't think it's fair to look at the what has transpired in isolation &mdash; I'm also *super* excited about the future, and the potential difference between the future and the past is what made me take the leap. It doesn't make this any less scary of a decision (leaving one's job), but I'd done it a few times before and it gets easier. Also, thank God I'd been saving for a while &mdash; so there's a nice cushion during which I can try a few things.

It'll take a while for things to set in &mdash; while it'll feel weird in the beginning, it's great to not have to join meetings that drag on, deal with the politics at work (surprisingly palpable for such a small company), the inefficiencies, grandstanding, empty announcements and shifting priorities.

Now it's time to let go and move on.

Bye Payfort.
