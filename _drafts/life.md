This post is for me. In these lines, I explain what my life goal is, why I'm doing it and how I plan to accomplish it.

## What is my goal?
Many more thoughtful people than myself have struggled to solve this issue on their own: "What is the purpose of life?". [Luckily for me](/islam), and for all Muslims, we've had help. Allah tells us in the Quran that the sole purpose of our creation is to serve _Him_. Of course, the next logical question is "How do I serve Allah?" to which the answer is &mdash; as best as you can (and unlike most things in life, intentions _do_ matter).

## Finding a problem worth solving

For further guidance, I decided that I'd do well to focus on solving a pressing issue &mdash; one that affects the Ummah today the most (with "Ummah" encompassing the set of living Muslims today). If I'm going to help out in the short time that I'm going to be around in this life, might as well attempt something worth doing, right? Right.

### Research

So I did some searching and came up with the below answers to the question (_What problems does the Muslim Ummah face?_):

1. Individualism (many people thinking "me" as opposed to "us")
2. Few prominent modern-day success stories
3. We're consumers, not producers. That makes us reactionary, and dependent on the world &mdash; pawns in a game, not influencers.
4. We feel powerless. Wars are a constant distraction (resulting in numbness, where a part of the Ummah is directly affected by the war, and the others are distanced from it by an overwhelming sense of helplessness). Governments are generally nonchalant, and this seems to lead individual members of society to feel powerless.
5. Low "self-esteem" &mdash; the feeling that we can't do anything right, continually citing examples of typical Arab or Muslim behavior where the moral of such tales is that the Ummah is so thoroughly flawed that there's no way out; we're necessarily doomed.

Like many social problems, it's pretty hard to measure these with any level of accuracy. And what you can't measure, you can't improve. Anecdotally, I know that these points ring true with me (and some unknown number of others, since I did find this list while researching). However, if we're going to move the needle here, we will require **more reliable data**. If you're going to dedicate your (working) life, and those of many others to this cause, then anecdotal accounts just won't cut it.

Another exercise we'll need to perform is to **separate the _causes_ from the _effects_**. Several of the points I listed above are intertwined and ideally we'll dedicate the limited resources we have to address root causes (rather than mere effects or symptoms of said causes). We'll know if we got it right once we've implemented the solutions &mdash; if the effects persist, then they would need to be addressed separately.

One thing you'll notice, across all five problems listed above, is that they are mostly intrinsic. By that, I mean that they are related to either our current state as Muslims or our perception of ourselves. As a result, the audience for any initiative we take would be the Muslims, first and foremost.

### Cleanup

I'm now going to take a closer look at the points above in an attempt to derive a subset, with points that:

a. Accurately describe the problem
b. Are measurable
c. Represent causes, rather than effects

`1 - Individualism` seems to me to be an effect &mdash; for lack of some cohesive alternative. We like hanging out with people that share a common interest, and yet we don't see much of that around Muslims.

`2 - Few success stories` and `3 - consumers, not producers` are unmistakably related. We don't solve our own problems and instead rely on solutions built elsewhere, then imported. This lack of initiative can lead to fewer people taking chances. The correlation is there, though my theory is that there is causation too. Becoming a more productive society overall would inevitably lead to more success stories.

Ideas for a metric that could accurately represent "productivity" as I describe it above include:
- Utility of the product/service, as measured by the utilization of the tools made by Muslims vs. those made by others (population being among Muslims themselves)
- Number of products used on a daily basis that were made by Muslims vs. those that were not

I'll need to think more about how best to measure this &mdash; and the actual metric may evolve. However, the concept it relates to (our "productivity" as a Muslim society) will remain central.

Additionally, it becomes clear that we'll need some way of differentiating products/services built by Muslims from those that are not (Additionally, we'll need to be more specific about what constitutes a Muslim product vs. a non-Muslim one? Is it the founder? The location it's built?).

`4 - We feel powerless`  and `5 - low collective self-esteem` are undoubtedly simultaneously both important and relevant. Without being specific, it's clear that many leaders of majority Muslim countries aren't great at what they do. This results in inefficient, short-sighted governments that are often reactionary and uninspiring. Helpless individuals follow, breeding more weak leaders, ad infinitum.

There remain motivated people among the public, and we often hear of fantastic initiatives launched by a small group that makes us hopeful. The question is how to measure this "feeling." How can we quantify our ability to effect change, and make a positive impact on our surroundings? This is starting to sound more and more like `2` & `3` above. After all, solving a problem is all about taking the initiative; it's the name of the game.
