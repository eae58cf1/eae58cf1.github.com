I just finished what I'm almost certain is going to be my last interaction with Facebook: the final technical interview, after the last interview returned inconclusive (one pass, one fail). The quesiton the guy asked was one I'd seen before, but just completely forgot (ironically, because I'd done so many other questions).

In every problem that you attempt to solve, there's a key insight that you need to get &mdash; without it, your solution is dirty and brute-forcy. It's the opposite of elegant. 

In this case, I had forgotten what it was. The question was as follows:

You are given an array of integers. Find the next permutation in the series (using the same set of elements)

e.g.:
given 1, 2, 3, 4 you would return 1, 2, 4, 3

If you reach the end (e.g. 4, 3, 1) just return the same array.

The solution I proposed was one where we would essentially find the smallest
