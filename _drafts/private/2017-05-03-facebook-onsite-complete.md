I just got back from the facebook onsite &mdash; it was pretty good overall.

The first two interviews were the technical ones, and these I think I struggled with the most. The first one was a problem I'd actually [worked on before](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2459653/how-to-find-smallest-substring-which-contains-all-characters-from-a-given-string) though I didn't [quite remember it](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/#/description). It was a sliding window problem, and I was able to solve it relatively well.

The next problem was more obtuse. The interviewer seemed to be pretty new at it, and he seemeed to be overzealous with looking for "gotchas" that I wasn't able to answer. His question was concerned with writing an iterator for a binary search tree, essentially implementing a next method that would return the next element of the BST in in-order traversal. This seemed similar to [the iterative iteration of BST](https://github.com/yazinsai/algorithms/blob/master/iterative-tree-traversal.rb) I'd worked on before, but with the added twist of returning a single element at a time. Tough question, and I think I had the elements of a working solution, but was unable to implement it without bugs.

This was it for the technical interviews. After a largely useless lunch with a solutions engineer (only got the program breakdown from &mdash; what happens after you join, namely a 2 month bootcamp, of which one month is spent in Menlo Park), I went back for the business interviews.

First was pretty straightforward. I was speaking with a guy in Dubai over a teleconference line, and it went reasonably well. Just had to BS through a few random points.

The next was with Bruce Hazan, head of Solutions Engineering. This was more intense. He asked me a bunch of higher-level strategic questions around approaches I would take to solving customer problems. We talked about client case studies, etc. and it went well overall (though he did ask some questions specifically about Facbeook Ad solutions that I was unaware of &mdash; e.g. the Lead Ads thing). Finally, I did the tech demo of [my Ads bot](https://github.com/yazinsai/facebook-ads-bot) which was well received.

That's it. I'll hear back Friday. Frankly, I don't think I'll make it through &mdash; we'll see.

## Update:

They called me to let me know that the second technical interview was the only roadblock in the way of extending an offer. They are going to repeat the interview this coming Friday, if I'm interested. They rarely ever do repeats, apparently &mdash; but they're willing to make an exception here. I agreed, so back to the study table.
