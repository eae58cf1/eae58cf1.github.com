Facebook said no. I'm not devestated, or heartbroken. Not surprised either, considering the last interview. It's over, and I'm glad it is &mdash; it's time to focus on what matters, which is myself. Building a business that can last. This was all one huge detour, starting all the way back from the Payfort fiasco. I should be focused on what matters &mdash; and that's not a paycheck in the mail each month. It's a sustainable business, with recurring revenue. Something that can grow to make a difference.

In fact, I think my parents are more worried about this whole thing than I am. I don't like that, but I can't control their feelings. I'll try to make them feel a bit better about it, but that's all I can do. Reassure them that things will work out for the best &mdash; I'm confident of at least that much. I look forward to the day when Facebook regrets their decision.

PS: I've also heard from Shopify in Montreal. Not so interested in it, but let's see what happens.
