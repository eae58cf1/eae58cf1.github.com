  I just finished taking the Gollup Strength Finder test, and I'd like to share my results with you.
---
I just completed the [Gallup Strengths Center](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/)'s Strength Finder test and thought I'd share the results. I've done several similar test in the past: there's the [16personalities](http://16personailities.com) test, as well as another test I did at GE (though I don't recall what the test was called, I got a "Director" result).

I'm naturally introspective, and the reason I took this test in particular is because I recently left my job to work on my own (again), and felt like I really want to know what my strengths are &hellip; to be able to capitalize on them. I'd had a vague sense of that before, but it's something I wanted to revisit.

The focus on stregth, as opposed to weaknesses, is deliberate &mdash; it allows you to be more productive in the short term (there's a period of reduced productivity that comes when you start learning, and I'm pretty confident in my ability to improve self-perceived weaknesses anyway from experience). So, strengths. I took the test, which promises to highlight your Top 5 strengths, and how you can use those strengths to improve your output.

## My results
Without further ado, here they are:

### 1. Learner
> You love to learn. 

Recommendations:
Continue to grow through learning:
- Refine how you learn. If you learn best by teaching (*and yes, I most certainly do!*), seek out opportunities to instruct others. *I'd been thinking about re-starting my Youtube posting, sharing lessons about things I'm currently learning &mdash; and I'm always reading something new &mdash; as a way to improve my retention*.
- Honor your desire to learn. If you can't fulfill this need at work, take advantage of adult educational opportunities in your community. *I generally learn through reading and researching (online, Youtube, etc.). I also learn alot through doing, which is something I'd like to spend more time trying. Incidentally, it's compatible with the point before (related to teaching; either via this site, or YouTube)*

### 2. Strategic
> The Strategic theme enables you to sort through the clutter and find the best route. It is not a skill that can be taught. It is a distinct way of thinking, a special perspective on the world at large. This perspective allows you to see patterns where others simply see complexity.

Recommendations:
Ask "What if?", then select and strike (*what?*):
- Your greatest contribution to a group may be to discover the best path to success. Because you can do this quickly (*I've always considered my ability to see through the clutter as being above average, and been somewhat surprised that others struggle to do what I can do with relative ease*), it may look as if you are "winging it", but explaining yourself along they way will help others understand what you see (*Also somehow related to teaching*).
- Schedule daily "quite time" devoted to considerations of your current goals and strategies. This focused time away from teh action might be the environment in which you are best able to think through the options to find the course of action. (*This is something I'm currently doing and &mdash; though I haven't published it yet &mdash; I am working on a life "masterplan" that I might end up sharing here. It details what I think my role in life is, what my goals during my lifetime are, and how I plan on achieving these goals.*)
- Trust your insights as much as possible. (*Interesting &hellip; this is an indication that I don't exercise enough conviction on matters that have far-reaching consequences, when I should.*)
- Because you naturally consider options at such a fast pace, even you might not know how you came up with the strategy &mdash; but because of your exceptional talents, it will likely be successful. (*I don't know if this is just part of the obligatory ego-massaging in order to encourage return customers, or if this is genuinely true; assuming the latter, it does sound complementary to the previous point around trusting insights. It's worth a shot.*)
- Find a group that you think does important work and contribute your Strategic thinking. You can be a leader with your ideas. (*I can't help but think that ideas are not as important as they might have once been. I've always purported the importance of execution over ideas, because ultimately that's what matters for small teams. Without execution, an idea is just a dream. And dreams are free. I just don't see this bit as being applicable to general projects; might be good advice in a work environment though.*)

### 3. Competition
> Competition is rooted in comparison. When you look at the world, you are instinctively aware of other people’s performance. Their performance is the ultimate yardstick.

> You like other competitors because they invigorate you.

> Although you are gracious to your fellow competitors and even stoic in defeat, you don’t compete for the fun of competing. You compete to win.

Recommendations: 
Aim for the first place, and you'll always finish strong.
- Create daily measures of success for you and the teams you are involved with. Strive to know what it takes to win consistently. (*I've often done exercises that have daily goals, and more medium-to-long term goals &hellip; but there's a void in the middle that needs bridging. Perhaps I need to have weekly plans instead, that tie up directly into a longer-term objective*)
- Take the time to celebrate your wins. In your world, there's no victory without celebration (*Something I don't feel like I do enough of, especially if you're working a startup on your own*).
- Seek competitive friends (*Great idea!*)

### 4. Restorative
> You love to solve problems. Whereas some are dismayed when they encounter yet another
breakdown, you can be energized by it. 

Recommendations:
Every problem has a solution. Use your talents to find it and fix it.
- Seek roles in which you are paid to solve problems. (*Sounds like any startup to me! If you're not solving (and I mean __really solving__ a pain, you're not winning*). You might particularly enjoy roles in medicine, consulting, computer programming, or customer serivce &mdash; in which your success depends on your ability to restore and resolve. (*That's a pretty diverse set of disciplines, though I do find it interesting that they listed programming; maybe that's part of why I like it so much &mdash; the ability to fix a problem right then and there*).
- Look for turnaround situations that others avoid. 
- You might be attracted to difficult problems, but also look for easy-to-solve problems that offer big results.
- Let everyone know that you enjoy fixing problems. It comes naturally to you, although some people may shy away from problems. You can help.

Funny enough, the example they used in the video explaining this strength was a Six Sigma Black Belt at a company &mdash; something I'd already done in a previous life at GE. They get me :')

### 5. Futuristic
> You are the kind of person who loves to peer over the horizon. The future fascinates you. As if it were projected on the wall, you see in detail what the future might hold, and this detailed picture keeps pulling you forward, into tomorrow.

> When the present proves too frustrating and the people around you too pragmatic, you conjure up your visions of the future and they energize you. They can energize others, too. In fact, very often people look to you to describe your visions of the future. They want a picture that can raise their sights and thereby their spirits. You can paint it for them. Practice. Choose your words carefully. Make the picture as vivid as possible. **People will want to latch on to the hope you bring**.

Recommendations:
Take time to envision the future. Anticipate and imagine what could and should be.
- Your natural anticipation of a better tomorrow enables you to overlook the pain and problems of today. Help others anticipate and imagine their futures as well. (*This applies to more than just the figurative today and tomorrow, but also to life as whole. I find the ultimate solace in challenging times in the fact that life is temporary*).
- Carve out time every week to put your ideas for the future in writing. You will clarify your vision for yourself and your team. (*Great point, will take time to do this &hellip; not necessarily to make new ones, but to revisit the existing vision*)
- Find a friend or colleague who possesses this theme. Set aside an hour a month for "future" discussions. Together, you can push each other to include more creativity and detail. (*I recall having one such futures discussion with a colleague at work &mdash; I did find it invigorating, exciting and a very worthwhile experience. Certainly something I'm planning to resume*).

---

So that's it &mdash; overall, pretty accurate and I have come up with a list of things that I plan to work on. I think playing on these strengths (learning by teaching, having greater conviction in your future strategy, etc.) can have a far-reaching impact on how I live my life in the next few years.
