<p>We’ve all seen it: front page headlines of “visionaries” gazing into the abyss .. every sentence attesting to the incredible success that he/she’s been able to conjure in the face adversity.</p>

<p>There’s just one thing missing: numbers.</p>

<p>I don’t know how you could possibly describe someone as successful without knowing what their financial status is like.. and this is especially true of entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>The media has a strong role to play in terms of getting the facts straight .. and I’m continually surprised at how, over and over again, we fall for this trap. I know of at least 3 entrepreneurs who’s businesses are failing miserably (2 of whom haven’t made a single $) and yet have been featured on newspapers across the region.</p>

<p>I call these guys <em>newspaperpreneurs</em>. Entrepreneurs in the eyes of the public, but hobbyists in real life (it’s easy to mix up a business and a hobby – Justin Wilcox does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g83DACZIebQ">an excellent job of explaining the difference</a>).</p>

<h2 id="the-solution-is-simple">The solution is simple</h2>

<p>Transparency. </p>

<p>For far too long, we’ve hidden behind the obscurity of the unknown (or worse, false perceptions). Nothing quite cuts through that like a nice strong dose of good ole fashioned transparency.</p>

<p>What should you be transparent about? Well, everything that matters.</p>

<p>Imagine if all companies out there published:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Revenue figures</li>
  <li>User registrations, engagement and churn rates</li>
  <li>Burn rates and net profit</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s the worst that could happen? </p>

<p>In fact, having done this before, I know that you’ll quickly start to realize some benefits .. especially in the early stages of a companies lifetime:</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-transparency">Benefits of transparency</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Added <strong>accountability</strong> and incentive to perform (the added peer pressure, knowing that everyone in the world will know if you screw up, is a great motivator to get off your butt and get stuff done).</li>
  <li><strong>Focus</strong> on what matters. Choosing the metrics carefully means that you’re always going to have them in front of you – setup as a public dashboard. The exercise of sharing this information with the public ensures that you’ll have to find a way to get real time visibility to the metrics that matter – something alot of companies don’t have today.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-commitment-to-transparency">My commitment to transparency</h2>

<p>Going forward, I pledge to transparency in the ventures I’m involved in today .. and ventures I engage in down the line. This follows in the footsteps of startups like <a href="http://moz.com/about/tagfee">Moz</a>, <a href="http://buffer.com">Buffer</a> and many others.</p>
