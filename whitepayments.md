## What is White?
[White Payments](http://whitepayments.com) was a company I founded in May 2014 to make it easy for startups in the Middle East to get paid online. It was acquired by [Payfort](https://payfort.com), the largest payment provider in the region, just one year later.

## Why a payment solution?
I didn't start off wanting to build a credit card processing service &hellip; I had plans to create an Uber-like service in my native Bahrain and had built all the bits of my MVP (Minimum Viable Product &mdash; essentially, a proof of concept), leaving the credit card part till the end. After finishing up the other stuff, I came to the credit card section and was lost. I'd originaly set aside a couple of hours for it, but hours came and went and I was no closer to finding a solution. Finally, when it became apparent that I'd need to meet a bank, I did &hellip; and was shocked at how backwards the whole experience was. I later found out that in Dubai, you had to pay $10,000 before you could start processing a single dollar. $10,000!

It quickly became clear to me that this was a bigger issue &mdash; one worth focusing on.

## What happened?
It's a long story. You can read more about it on the Startup Bahrain page [here](http://www.startupmgzn.com/english/features/white-payments-never-give-up/) but in a nutshell: I built a first version, hired a CTO, launched to the public, processed six figures, got shut down by our only bank and finally got acquired. All in a year.
