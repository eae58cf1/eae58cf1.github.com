Here, I'll describe my motiviations for working on this project, how I plan to do it and what is the ultimate outcome I'm working towards.

One crucial area (something I'd missed out in the [Perpetual](/perpetual/masterplan) project) is identifying the missing &mdash; my **why**.

## Why? (The Problem)
We live in a world where information travels at the speed of light; a world where anyone can follw events as they unfold anywhere in the world. Yet, we seem unable to extend a hand of help to those in places that have the greatest need for our help. We all stood, helpless, when we saw images from [Madaya](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/09/middleeast/syria-madaya-starvation/index.html). While it's shocking that corrupt regimes would use starvation as a war tactic, it's more shocking that individuals and aid agencies don't seem to have any recourse outside of [waiting for those same governments](http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2016/01/20/ban-ki-moon-speaks-about-madaya-war-crimes-curnow.cnn) to reach some sort of resolution. With every passing day, children and families perish.

> that most people in hard-to-reach and besieged areas remain difficult for the United
Nations and their implementing partners to reach with humanitarian assistance, (UN Security Council [Resolution 2191](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/doc/2191))

The problem isn't raising money for aid &mdash; it's logistical. How can you get aid into a place that's under siege by ground troops. By air, that's how.

UAVs have existed since the 1940s, and are used extensively in the military. However, there are civilian drones capable of delivering supplies to these areas. Why aren't they being used? I'm flabbergasted.

## FAQs

**Is it legal to use drones in cross-border?**
A UN resolution was issued that
