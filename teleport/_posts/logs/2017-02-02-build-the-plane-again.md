title: Build the plane again
---
After the [first failed attempt](/teleport/logs/build-the-plane), I was able to retrieve the plane from the tree (using a rope and a bag of sand to pull the branch down):

The plane body was mostly in tact, so I'll be using the same frame. I'll be making the changes we discussed after the last attempt, namely:
1. Increase propeller size to 6 inches (from 5 inches previously)
2. Reduce weight of the plane by using a smaller battery pack
3. Use autopilot from the get-go. No manual flying

Also, some minor things to remember to do (based on the state of the retrieved plane):
1. Make sure that the ESC is configured with a voltage cut-off. The motor was running even after the plane crashed into the tree, and continued to run until the 3-cell LiPo battery I was using was drained to 1.2V across all 3 cells! Luckily, I was able to [charge it back](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1072324-(HOW-TO)-Recovering-over-discharged-lipos).
2. Put lock-tight on the bullet prop adapter to prevent it from flying off. I lost mine somewhere in the woods.
3. Properly secure the servos inside the fuselage (for elevator and rudder). Noticed that these were loose when inspecting the plane post-crash.

Onwards&hellip;
