After the APM burned out following my [successful flight](/teleport/logs/mini-flight-take-4) yesterday, I swapped it out for another APM I had lying around. That didn't work unfortunately (I'd bought it off eBay a while ago, and it was crap). I ordered another one, and now waiting till it arrives (expected delivery on Wednesday).

That's what sucks about hardware projects like this &mdash; whereas a software project is always waiting on you, here you're waiting on part deliveries (I'm also still waiting on the full-sized model too, which got pushed back a month; looks like the Chinese factory is waiting to do a million-product run in order for the economics to work out).

Alas, wait we shall until Wednesday for the waypoint flight.
