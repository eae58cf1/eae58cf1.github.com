After the APM burned out following my [successful flight](/teleport/logs/mini-flight-take-4) yesterday, I swapped it out for another APM I had lying around. That didn't work unfortunately (I'd bought it off eBay a while ago, and it was crap). I ordered another one, and now waiting till it arrives (expected delivery on Wednesday).

That's what sucks about hardware projects like this &mdash; whereas a software project is always waiting on you, here you're waiting on part deliveries (I'm also still waiting on the full-sized model too, which got pushed back a month; looks like the Chinese factory is waiting to do a million-product run in order for the economics to work out).

Alas, wait we shall until Wednesday for the waypoint flight.

## Received the GPS unit for the F3
I just received the NEO-8MN GPS unit [I was waiting on](/teleport/logs/build-the-plane-again/#the-autopilot) in order to get the F3 flight controller (from Seriously Pro) working in autonomous mode. Unfortunately, after extensive testing it was clear that the GPS unit I received was a cheap clone, and did **not** work (I'd ordered it from a Chinese store online, so I'm not exactly shocked).

I've ordered a replacement, but that does set me back while I wait for it to come in. Still no autopilot, so we can't go ahead.

> Update: I'm going to be offline for the next 3 days, until Monday the 20th of Feb. I'll resume posting from then onwards.
