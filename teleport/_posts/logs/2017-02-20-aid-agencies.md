An important part of the project involves my ability to do actual on-the-ground tests to prove the concept. This means working with partners in countries that border Syria &mdash; namely Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan (and Iraq, but that place is volatile enough as is).

The challenge then becomes figuring out a way of reaching agencies that would be interested in assisting. I haven't tried this before, so we'll need some sort of preliminary strategy.

I'm considering the below:
- reach out to individuals affiliated with air organizations via LinkedIn
- reach out to organizations present in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan directly via email
- consider the SU/WFP program [here](https://su.org/gic/2017/wfp/) (Applications close: March 13, 2017). This plugs you in directly to the UN WFP
