An important part of the project involves my ability to do actual on-the-ground tests of the pproof of concept. This means working with partners in countries that border Syria &mdash; namely Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan (and Iraq, but that place is volatile enough as is).

The challenge then becomes figuring out a way of reaching agencies that would be interested in assisting. I haven't tried this before, so we'll need some sort of preliminary strategy.

I'm considering the below:
- reach out to organizations present in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan directly via email
- reach out to individuals affiliated with relevant aid organizations via LinkedIn
- a fried also told me to consider the SU/WFP program [here](https://su.org/gic/2017/wfp/) (Applications close: March 13, 2017). This would plug me in directly to the UN WFP, which should make things easier from an implementation perspective.

## Reach out to organizations

The basic strategy here is:
1. Create a compelling value proposition
2. Find active aid agencies in the border countries to Syria
3. Reach out to these aid agencies, brute-force style

### Find active aid agencies

#### Turkey

After some extensive searching, I came across [this list](http://www.unhcr.org/turkey/home.php?lang=en&page=17) of UNHCR implementing partners in Turkey. There's another list [here](http://www.unhcr.org/528a0a34a.pdf) on Page 5. 

This is a good place to start:
1. [UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/turkey.html)
2. 
3. 

#### Lebanon

I found a list of [UNHCR implementing partners](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20160305055323/http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e486676.html) on an older version of their website, which they've since removed.
