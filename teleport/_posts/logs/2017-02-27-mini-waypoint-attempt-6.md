## New plane build
Luckily, I had a spare AXN on hand so I immediately got busy building it again (something I can now do in my sleep!). I decided to add in an FPV (First Person View) camera gear on the plane so that I can see what's going on at all times. I'm also going to be painting it bright colors, and adding a buzzer for an alarm.

I still want to give the APM a chance, but something tells me that I'll be better off moving to the Pixhawk PX4, or the [SP F3 controller](http://seriouslypro.com/spracingf3). I really want to get this tried and tested before my full-scale plane arrives (sometime early next week!).

I need to move quickly, but with zero tolerance for mistakes &mdash; certainly not ones I've done before (and there are plenty by now).

## Changes from previous models
I'm making quite a few changes from the previous models I've built to date &hellip; many prompted in an attempt to reduce the risk of the plane getting lost:

- Adding camera gear for FPV flying
- Painting it a really bright color (so I can see it in the sky)
- Adding buzzer so I can find it when it crashes
- Add telemetry so I can get plane information at my remote control
- Swapped the AXN motor for the Turnigy 2730-1300 (I don't have a spare AXN on hand)
- Configure failsafe on the transmitter

Again, I'll be following many of the best practices listed [here](http://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/AXN_Clouds_Fly_Setup).
