I've started work on building the full-sized MyTwinDream that I received last week. This plane is HUGE and I can easily see how it can carry several kilograms of payload for delivery, in addition to the loads of batteries it'll need to go long range.

Since I [no longer have the Pixhawk](/teleport/logs/mini-waypoint-attempt-6/), I'll be using a Pixracer (a newer, smaller version of the original Pixhawk). I'll also be using a custom battery pack made from the LiIon cells I'd developed previously (but were too heavy to include in the smaller AXN).

- Installed and centered all of the control surfaces
- Installed the airspeed sensor
- Got the GPS working

**Update (March 17):**

- Connected control surfaces to flight controller
- Installed the radio receiver

It's worth noting that this is a fairly large plane &mdash; definitely the largest I've built to date. I've also got huge 11 inch propellers installed on the dual motors, so we're talking about huge amounts of thrust!

Here are some progress pics:

I also finally received the other 40A ESC I was waiting for (I only had one), so now I can test the whole plane.

I'll be working on the Lithium Ion battery pack once I receive the copper rod I've ordered in order to make my own spot welder. I tried to find one in the nearby university, but they didn't have one (strange!).
