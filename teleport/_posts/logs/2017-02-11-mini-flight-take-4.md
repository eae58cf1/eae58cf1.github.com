title: Scaled flight &mdash; Take 4
---
Since [the last attempt](/teleport/logs/mini-flight-take-3) we learned that we're going to have to shed some weight (or increase the thrust) in order to keep the plane in the air. That's what I'll be doing before this 4th attempt.

> Goal: Lose 123 - 143 grams

## Losing weight
Let's do an inventory of the top 3 heaviest items:
- Battery: 148g
- Power module: 41g
- APM: 32g
