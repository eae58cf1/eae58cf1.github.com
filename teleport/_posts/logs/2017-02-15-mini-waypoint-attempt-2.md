I took off in Stabilize mode into the wind, and would attempt to gain altitude before flicking it into AUTO.

That never happened though. As soon as I launched it, it struggled to move forward (relative to the ground, it was actually hovering in place!). It then started moving backwards as the wind picked up even more. I was able to gain altitude, but keeping things under control was becoming a serious challenge, even at full throttle.

In the interest of not losing the plane, I brought it down and decided to try again tomorrow.
