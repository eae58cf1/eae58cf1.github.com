    <h1 class="page-title">Build the plane</h1>
  

  <div class="meta"><span>February 02, 2017</span></div>
<p>Having <a href="/teleport/logs/plane-design">already decided</a> on the airframe we’ll be using, the next step is to test it. However, the large plane that I ordered is going to take close to a month to arrive. In the mean time, I’ll be running smaller form test (using ~1m wingspan foamies) to make sure that our fundamental assumptions are valid.</p>

<p>After all, I don’t want the large 2m wingspan MTD plane to be my first attempt at such a test; a crash landing would mean another month of waiting!</p>

<h2 id="the-smaller-test">The smaller test</h2>
<p>I ordered a couple of the <a href="https://hobbyking.com/en_us/floater-jet-epo-arf.html">AXN Clouds Fly</a> floater, which arrived next day. This is smaller (just 1.1m wingspan) with a much lower wing area (remember that a proportionally sized 2m wing has 4 times the wing area of a 1m wing, not double). Still, the goal with this plane is a simple one: <strong>run an autonomous flight as far as we possibly can</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="build">Build</h2>
<p>The foamie I ordered was just the body — it did not include any electronics, so I had to plug in the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Radio receiver</li>
  <li>Motor, electronic speed controller</li>
  <li>Autopilot (APM 2.8)</li>
  <li>Battery</li>
  <li>Servos (for control surfaces: ailerons, rudder and elevator)</li>
</ul>

<p>The setup is pretty involved, and took me a good 5 hours to complete.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p>Here’s a pic of the baby with everything installed (forgive the grainy mess, it’ll be explained shortly):
<img src="/assets/projects/teleport/axn-grainy-mess.png" alt="AXN grainy mess" /></p>

<p>For detailed build steps, I followed <a href="http://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/AXN_Clouds_Fly_Setup">this guide</a></p>

<p>Once the build was complete, it was time for a maiden flight</p>

<h2 id="the-maiden-flight">The maiden flight</h2>
<p>For this first flight, I used a 2200 mAh Hobbyking battery, though I did plan to replace it with LiIon 3400 mAh batteries that have roughly double the energy density.</p>

<p>So I went to a nearby field, and took it out for a spin:</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: The video won’t be winning any Oscars, but it does capture a part of the crash in a few of the frames :/ I’ll try and setup the camera so it’s actually pointing at the plane in the next attempt.</p>

<p>The flight went well initially, with the plane maintaining steady flight — though it did tend to pitch downwards. I tried trimming it up but that didn’t really address the issue. It was still pitching down. I also noticed the controls had too much authority, so I changed the weight of the controls from my transmitter.</p>

<p>In the end, I was able to get it to fly in a semi-stable state but it did not gain much altitude. When I applied elevator, it would pitch up suddenly, then pitch down after I let go — in a see-saw fashion.</p>

<p>Eventually, the plane crashed in a tree — too high for me to retrieve:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/projects/teleport/axn-stuck-tree.png" alt="Stuck in Tree" /></p>

<p>I hadn’t had much practice flying fixed wing craft so maybe I just didn’t know what I was doing. It’s a tertiary point though — the mission does not (and should not) depend on my ability to fly the plane.</p>

<p>I’ve now revised <a href="/teleport">the plan</a> to include Autonomous flights only and not manual ones. This also saves me the trouble of figuring out how to get radio communication working over long distances.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t learn to fly a plane with a real plane. Use a simulator to get the hang of things first, or just use an autopilot with waypoints configured</li>
  <li>The plane has to be able to gain altitude quicker
    <ul>
      <li>Increase propeller size for more power</li>
      <li>Reduce the weight of the plane (use smaller battery pack, autopilot)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>I’ll run another test with the spare body that I have.</p>

<p>The changes I’ll make:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a larger prop to provide more power (I’ll use a 6 inch prop instead of the 5 inch stock) resulting in quicker climbs. Reducing the weight will also help, since lower wing loading means faster climbs too.</li>
  <li>Add GPS and use waypoint or loiter flights (in loiter flight, the plane just flys around in circles at a fix altitude). I’ll try and use a smaller autopilot since the APM is pretty big.</li>
</ul>
