    <h1 class="page-title">Aid Agencies</h1>
  

  <div class="meta"><span>March 01, 2017</span></div>
<p>An important part of the project involves my ability to do actual on-the-ground tests of the pproof of concept. This means working with partners in countries that border Syria — namely Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan (and Iraq, but that place is volatile enough as is).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/projects/teleport/syria-neighboring-countries.png" alt="Neighboring countries to Syria" /></p>

<p>The challenge then becomes figuring out a way of reaching agencies that would be interested in assisting. I haven’t tried this before, so we’ll need some sort of preliminary strategy. I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid_during_the_Syrian_Civil_War">this Wikipedia entry</a> on aid in Syria — it describes the organizations involved and the capacity of their involvement. That’ll be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Next, I’m considering the below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reach out to organizations present in Turkey first (Lebanon, Jordan later). I’ll reach them directly via email</li>
  <li>reach out to individuals affiliated with relevant aid organizations via LinkedIn</li>
  <li>a friend also told me to consider applying to the SU/WFP program <a href="https://su.org/gic/2017/wfp/">here</a> (Applications close: March 13, 2017). This would plug me in directly to the UN WFP, which should make things easier from an implementation perspective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>

<p>The goal is to get the pilot flight done <strong>legally</strong>, and as quickly as possible. If I could just pop into Turkey, do the test flight and come back — that’d be ideal (for this initial stage of the project).</p>

<p>The basic strategy here is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reach out to Turkish Civil Aviation authority to understand requirements</li>
  <li>If local partner required:
    <ul>
      <li>reach out to the UN (UNHCR &amp; WFP to begin with) and seek introduction to local partners
        <ul>
          <li>If UN unresponsive/unwilling, reach active aid agencies directly</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-create-compelling-value-proposition">1. Create compelling value proposition</h3>

<p>Since I’ll be starting off with the UN, I’d need to understand more about the problem, specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What it costs them to do aid deliveries today</li>
  <li>The number of areas that they are unable to reach that this project can directly impact</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d also need to be very clear about what it is I’m asking from them.</p>

<h3 id="find-active-aid-agencies">Find active aid agencies</h3>

<h4 id="turkey">Turkey</h4>

<p>After some extensive searching, I came across <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/turkey/home.php?lang=en&amp;page=17">this list</a> of UNHCR implementing partners in Turkey. There’s another list <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/528a0a34a.pdf">here</a> on Page 5.</p>

<p>To keep things sane, I fired up <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_8XafaeXpXfYooO_CbnF-K-GcnW_GxHAbrLEYJDfDe4/edit?usp=sharing">a Google sheet</a> to track the status of the different interactions I’m following up on.</p>
