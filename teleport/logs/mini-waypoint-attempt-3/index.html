<h3 id="gale-force-winds">Gale force winds</h3>

<p>The next day, we had gale-force winds. Not a good day for science:</p>

<h3 id="third-attempt">Third attempt</h3>

<p>Today was the perfect day for the next attempt. I took the plane out in the morning and ran all the pre-flight checks:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/projects/teleport/axn-take-5.png" alt="Take 5" /></p>

<p>The plane was stable, but it had trouble gaining altitude. I’d checked the weight and that definitely wasn’t it. There was a bit of wind but not enough to hinder ascent. I don’t have an airspeed sensor on this mini-aircraft so I don’t know if the wind was an issue (airspeed - ground speed from GPS would tell me the net wind speed at the nose). It really was quite strange. I flicked it into Loiter mode at about 20m up and it started to lose altitude so I switched it back to Stabilize mode. The battery wasn’t running at 100% (the voltage was close to 11.6V) but that couldn’t be it either.</p>

<p>When I inspected it up close, I noticed that the motor mount was loose (probably from a few previous landings). The mount itself was supposed to be screwed onto the body, but the nut had fallen off and was now held together by some tape. I didn’t think it was an issue since this was a pusher configuration and there wouldn’t be separation stress on the mount. I might’ve been wrong though. A wobbly motor could certainly qualify as a contributing factor.</p>

<p>Changes made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated <code class="highlighter-rouge">THR_MAX=100</code> (it was previously 75, which limited the maximum throttle value that the APM would apply).</li>
  <li>I fixed the motor mount down with some wood screws that were significantly larger than the original holes. This gave me a very strong hold, without the need for a nut on the other side of the mount.</li>
</ul>
