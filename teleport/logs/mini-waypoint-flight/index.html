    <h1 class="page-title">Mini Waypoint Flight</h1>
  

  <div class="meta"><span>February 26, 2017</span></div>
<p>After the APM burned out following my <a href="/teleport/logs/mini-flight-take-4">successful flight</a> yesterday, I swapped it out for another APM I had lying around. That didn’t work unfortunately (I’d bought it off eBay a while ago, and it was crap). I ordered another one, and now waiting till it arrives (expected delivery on Wednesday).</p>

<p>That’s what sucks about hardware projects like this — whereas a software project is always waiting on you, here you’re waiting on part deliveries (I’m also still waiting on the full-sized model too, which got pushed back a month; looks like the Chinese factory is waiting to do a million-product run in order for the economics to work out).</p>

<p>Alas, wait we shall until Wednesday for the waypoint flight.</p>

<h2 id="received-the-gps-unit-for-the-f3">Received the GPS unit for the F3</h2>
<p>I just received the NEO-8MN GPS unit <a href="/teleport/logs/build-the-plane-again/#the-autopilot">I was waiting on</a> in order to get the F3 flight controller (from Seriously Pro) working in autonomous mode. Unfortunately, after extensive testing it was clear that the GPS unit I received was a cheap clone, and did <strong>not</strong> work (I’d ordered it from a Chinese store online, so I’m not exactly shocked).</p>

<p>I’ve ordered a replacement, but that does set me back while I wait for it to come in. Still no autopilot, so we can’t go ahead.</p>

<h2 id="apm-replacement-is-in">APM replacement is in</h2>
<p>Finally received my APM and set it up. This worked well, and I also discovered why the previous one didn’t. The old one failed in the compass calibration process; upon further inspection, I discovered that there was <a href="https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/ardupilot-apm-2-8-flight-controller-board/">a jumper that’s used to select the compass</a>. Once I set that, it worked fine.</p>

<p>So I got everything in place, and took it out for a spin — despite ridiculously strong wind conditions (~45kph winds):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/projects/teleport/take-5-ready-to-go.png" alt="AXN ready to go" /></p>

<p>I setup the plane with some waypoints set around the football pitch and configured the AUTO mode on my radio controller.</p>
