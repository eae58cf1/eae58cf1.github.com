<p>I took off in Stabilize mode into the wind, and would attempt to gain altitude before flicking it into AUTO.</p>

<p>That never happened though. As soon as I launched it, it struggled to move forward (relative to the ground, it was actually hovering in place!). It then started moving backwards as the wind picked up even more. I was able to gain altitude, but keeping things under control was becoming a serious challenge, even at full throttle.</p>

<p>In the interest of not losing the plane, I brought it down and decided to try again tomorrow.</p>
