<em>Note: I originally started a project called ["Perpetual"](/perpetual) with the aim of building a plane capable of perpetual flight. It's since morphed into this project (more details [here](/teleport/masterplan)).</em>

## Overview

> 🎯 **Grand goal**: Allow anyone to directly assist people in need anywhere in the world. 

- [Masterplan](/teleport/masterplan). You really want to read this first.

## Project status

**🚧  Checkpoint #1: Deliver an orange 25km away and return autonomously**

- ✅ [Determine design attributes required for plane](/teleport/logs/plane-design)
- ✅ Build / procure the scaled-down plane
  - ✅ Order the full-sized plane 
  - ✅ [Build the scaled-down model](/teleport/logs/build-the-plane/)
- ✅ Run an autonomous flight with the scaled-down plane
