<em>Note: I originally started a project called ["Perpetual"](/perpetual) with the aim of building a plane capable of perpetual flight. It's since morphed into this project (more details [here](/teleport/masterplan)).</em>

## Overview

> 🎯 **Grand goal**: Allow anyone to directly assist people in need anywhere in the world. 

- [Masterplan](/teleport/masterplan). You really want to read this first.

## Project status

**Checkpoint #1: Deliver an orange 25km away and return autonomously**

- ✅ [Determine design attributes required for plane](/teleport/logs/plane-design)
- ✅ Build / procure the scaled-down plane
  - ✅ Order the full-sized plane &mdash; *getting the MyTwinDream; expected delivery mid-Feb*
  - ✅ [Build the scaled-down model](/teleport/logs/build-the-plane/)
- [ ] Run an autonomous flight with the scaled-down plane
  - ❎ 1<sup>st</sup> flight attempt: [Failed](/teleport/logs/build-the-plane)
  - ❎ 2<sup>nd</sup> flight attempt: [Failed](/teleport/logs/build-the-plane-again)
  - ➡️️ 3<sup>rd</sup> flight attempt: ongoing
- [ ] Test autonomous flight with scaled-down plane
- [ ] Build full-sized plane
- [ ] Test autonomous flight with full-sized plane
- [ ] Setup payload test (an orange)
- [ ] Test flight with payload release
- [ ] Communicate with aid agencies in Lebanon/Turkey for test flight
- [ ] Fly there and test orange delivery!
