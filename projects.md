Projects are BIG things I work on from time to time to time, and ideally make up some concrete step forward in my grand life plan. They last several months to several years! 

Here's a list of big projects that I'm working on (and have worked on in the past):

- [Project Perpetual](/perpetual) &mdash; **Ongoing**: My goal with this project is to create a plane that's capable of perpetual flight.

- [White Payments](/whitepayments) &mdash; **Ended**: My goal was to build a payment solution for the startups in the Middle East region. One that makes it really easy to start an online business.
