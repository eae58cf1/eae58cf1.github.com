<h2 id="my-understanding">My understanding</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of things we just don’t know as humans .. and that makes life alot more interesting. If I look at how alot of things function today, and this could be anything — the stock market, food, the internet, voting, whatever. All these things were built by other humans at a point in time in the past where it was not abundantly clear how they would be used (certainly not compared to today). That is to say that I, as a user of this service/technology today, have more knowledge than the person who built it at the time they built it.</p>

<p>I’m thus empowered to change it, to improve it using the tools we have today to optimize the task it’s being used for.</p>

<p>God’s already made it easy; he’s given me power over my environment, the animals; he’s furnished all the building blocks of life. It’s now my turn to take that and run with it.</p>

<p>I find this view refreshing in many senses — when you think about the realm of possibilities for change this way, you realize that they are <em>countless</em>.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: The World is big. Explore it. Change it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
<em>This is a description of my understanding of the verses in the Quran, and not the real true meaning of the verse. My understanding changes over time – I see many things differently than I did 3 years ago, and my understanding can (nay, it should) evolve with time. Think about how your understanding of the role of parents changes as you grow – first as a kid, then a teenager and later as a parent yourself. Your understanding evolves with time. The true meaning of the verses however, does not. I make absolutely no claims that this is in any way a resemblance of the true meaning of the verses. Instead, this is really just meant to be a record for me – a notebook of sorts, where I think over the meaning verses and try to glean valuable lessons with which I hope to apply to better myself.</em></p>
