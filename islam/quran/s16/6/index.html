  <div class="quran-verse">وَإِنْ تَعُدُّوا نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ لَا تُحْصُوهَا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ {18}
وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُسِرُّونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ {19}
وَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ لَا يَخْلُقُونَ شَيْئًا وَهُمْ يُخْلَقُونَ {20}
أَمْوَاتٌ غَيْرُ أَحْيَاءٍ ۖ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبْعَثُونَ {21}</div>

<h2 id="my-understanding">My understanding</h2>

<p>I know I think that I do this enough, or almost enough .. but trust me, it isn’t. I can always do more.</p>

<p>I know that when I look at people I know, and realize how much more they make than I do .. then I can’t help feeling abit upset. I can do better. I can make more. But that’s not what I should be spending my time thinking about.</p>

<p>A better place to start is from the ground up, not from your current level up. Look at all the blessings you have that other people don’t. Clothing, food, electricity, access to the sum of the world’s information (the Internet), an able body .. and so much more! There’s something to be grateful about!</p>

<p>Even if you have absolutely nothing but an able body, that’s already better than so many others that don’t have <em>even</em> that.</p>

<p>To be grateful is to be alive. What’s important is to always realize that my value is not in the balance of my bank account — it’s in the impact that I’m able to achieve as a result. Money typically follows.</p>

<!-- I remember watching a video talk about the difference between living and surviving. Surviving is basically keeping a heartbeat &mdash; but not much more. It's monotonous, uneventful and overwhelmingly cliche. Living, is different. When you live, you take chances &mdash; somedays you're up, and others you're down. That fluctuation can often induce a sense of gratitude .. allowing you to reassess your position. Whereas mere months ago, you couldn't do \\(X\\) .. but now you can. That's an opportunity to reflect on your blessings .. and it just tends -->

<p><strong>TL;DR: You’ve got more than you think — be grateful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
<em>This is a description of my understanding of the verses in the Quran, and not the real true meaning of the verse. My understanding changes over time – I see many things differently than I did 3 years ago, and my understanding can (nay, it should) evolve with time. Think about how your understanding of the role of parents changes as you grow – first as a kid, then a teenager and later as a parent yourself. Your understanding evolves with time. The true meaning of the verses however, does not. I make absolutely no claims that this is in any way a resemblance of the true meaning of the verses. Instead, this is really just meant to be a record for me – a notebook of sorts, where I think over the meaning verses and try to glean valuable lessons with which I hope to apply to better myself.</em></p>
