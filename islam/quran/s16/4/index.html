<h2 id="my-understanding">My understanding</h2>

<p>There are countless examples of things that I get from my environment that I didn’t actually strive for. From the air I breathe, to the food/water on the table to hundreds and hundreds of other things that are required to both build life and to sustain it.</p>

<p>First and foremost is to realize that these are grants from God and that I should be grateful. The idea is that while I know that this ultimately comes from God, I should also be grateful to the people through which this blessing is provided (my dad, mom, friends, etc.).</p>

<p>Next, in order to be truly grateful, I must utilize these blessings to the max.. that’s the best way I know of to truly express that gratitude. If I gave a guy $50 and he went and turned it into $5,000 .. then sure, he’d be happy — but I would too; I’d feel like the money I gave him went a long way, and was properly utilized.</p>

<p>This becomes especially important when I realize that there are others that are deprived of these same things that I’ve been given so abundantly. Whether it’s the hungry, the orphans or the people at war — to be truly grateful is to recognize their plight and strive to help them, while also being cognizant of the fact that I have done very little to deserve all the blessings I’ve been given, that others have not.</p>

<p>Being truly thankful — not thankful by just saying it, but genuinely feeling like you have alot to be thankful about .. <strong>that is imperative</strong>. If I’m constantly comparing myself to people that <em>have more than I do</em> (and they, in turn will compare themselves to others that have <em>even more</em>), then that just tends to make a group of ungrateful and unhappy people.*</p>

<p>I’d much rather be happy.</p>

<p><em>Just to clarify, it is *good</em> to compare yourself to people that are <em>better</em> than you in ways that are important to you. That can serve as a catalyst for you to get better.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Be grateful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
<em>This is a description of my understanding of the verses in the Quran, and not the real true meaning of the verse. My understanding changes over time – I see many things differently than I did 3 years ago, and my understanding can (nay, it should) evolve with time. Think about how your understanding of the role of parents changes as you grow – first as a kid, then a teenager and later as a parent yourself. Your understanding evolves with time. The true meaning of the verses however, does not. I make absolutely no claims that this is in any way a resemblance of the true meaning of the verses. Instead, this is really just meant to be a record for me – a notebook of sorts, where I think over the meaning verses and try to glean valuable lessons with which I hope to apply to better myself.</em></p>
