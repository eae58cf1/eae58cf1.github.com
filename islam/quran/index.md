At the heart of Islam is the Quran, a 1,3{{ site.time | date: '%y' | plus: 68 }} year old book that captures God's words to us. It's like a manual for all Muslims. My belief is that the lessons     in the Quran can not only help Muslims, but any person, become a better individual.

The quran comprises of 114 chapters for a total of about 611 pages. 

I'm reading through the Quran and will be sharing some of the insights that I'm gathering as I progress in a few short notes.

You'll find these here, grouped by Chapter:
