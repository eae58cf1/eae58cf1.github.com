# 16 - Surat Al Nahl  

I'm not really sure why I picked this chapter to start with &mdash; it just seemed right at the time. Here's a breakdown of the different posts I've written on this chapter, broken down by verse:

{% capture freshstart %}{{'now' | date: '%s' | minus: 86400 }}{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.categories.16 reversed %}
  - [{{post.title}}]({{ post.url }})
{% endfor %}

{% include islam/quran/disclaimer.md %}
