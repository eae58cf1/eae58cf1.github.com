I'm on a mission to build a perpetually flying plane &mdash; a plane that stays in the air **forever** and never has to land.

- [Masterplan](masterplan/). You'll want to read this first.
- Flight logs
- [Lessons learned](lessons/)

## Project status

- [ ] Pick a decent wing shape (airfoil) and size
  - [X] [Deciding on an aircraft form](logs/aircraft-form) &mdash; Decided: Fixed wing
  - [X] [General guidelines for wing design](logs/general-guidelines-for-wing-design)
  - [ ] Design some rough parameters for the wing
- [ ] Find the drag at desired/expected operating conditions
- [ ] Pick a motor that can handle that drag, and then some
- [ ] Find required storage and generation parameters
- [ ] Simulate the plane before construction
- [ ] Build a scaled version and test it
- [ ] Get feedback, rinse and repeat
