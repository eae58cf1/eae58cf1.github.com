    <h1 class="page-title">Intial wing design parameters</h1>
  

  <p>The purpose of this step is to come up with some sort of initial design for the aircraft wing. This would include span, chord and airfoil shape — as well as thickness of the wing. We’re going to be using expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam for the wing material since that’s all I have available. Ideally, I’d find something to laminate it with in order to reduce it’s Reynolds number.</p>

<!-- update previous post to talk about reynolds number -->

<p>Since I don’t know much about wing design, besides <a href="/logs/general-guidelines-for-wing-design">the guidelines we discussed</a> in the last post, I’m going to use the help of a simulator. The specific one I’ll be using is <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/foil3.html">NASA’s FoilSim III</a> — which I found really surprisingly easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It’s easy to use but it was a nightmare to setup. I had to create a Windows virtual machine (since I’m running a Mac) and install the Java SDK and disable all security settings before I could get the 15 year old Java applet to finally run.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/projects/perpetual/nasa-foilsim.png" alt="NASA FoilSIM III" /></p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Before messing around with the FoilSim app, just keep the design parameters in mind:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{Lift} = \text{Plane Weight} + ~30\%</script>

<p>The 30% there is a buffer.</p>

<p>Also,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low wing loading (\(\lt 50 kg/m^2\))</li>
  <li>High aspect ratio</li>
</ul>

<p>While we’d normally need some sort of weight measurement, I’m going to consider 1.5kg as a good starting point (for batteries, solar cells and wing body) considering a miniature version of our plane. At the end of this exercise, we’ll consider whether this is a meaningful number or not — but let’s not let that hold us up for now.</p>

<p>Here’s what we expect to get from FoilSim:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drag, in Newtons (which is the force that our motor will need to overcome)</li>
  <li>Speed (to tell us what speed we should fly for efficient energy consumption)</li>
  <li>Stall speed (we need to <strong>always fly above the stall speed</strong>)</li>
  <li>Wing dimensions (span, chord, airfoil shape)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="foilsim-time">FoilSim time</h2>

<p>While messing with FoilSim, I learned a few things that I really should clarify:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The lift changes with angle of attack (the incline of the wing, relative to the horizontal plane). I considered the \(\text{Lift} = \text{Weight} + 30\%\) guideline above at the neutral angle of attack of \(\alpha = 3 \deg\).</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s the result:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/projects/perpetual/nasa-foilsim-results-v1.png" alt="NASA FoilSIM III" /></p>

<p>Ended up looking somewhat similar to <a href="http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=e214-il">this glider airfoil</a>, even though I just messed around with alot of knobs until I found the results I was looking for. If I knew how to simulate the simulator, I could write a loop to test ranges of values and programmatically find the most desired result. Anyway, the results are pretty good (though definitely not the best possible).</p>

<p>I had to pick a higher speed of 30 km/h in order to get the necessary lift (16N ≈ 1.6kg). Here’s the raw output data in txt format (<a href="/assets/projects/perpetual/airfoil-v1.txt">View wing data</a>).</p>
